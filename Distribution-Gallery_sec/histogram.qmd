title: Histogram

A histogram uses rectangular bars to represent the frequency of data within specific intervals, where the total area of the bars corresponds to the total frequency. It is primarily used to visualize the distribution of continuous variables.

## Example

This basic histogram illustrates the expression levels of the `TSPAN6` gene across different samples. The x-axis represents the data values, with each bar covering a specific range of values, while the y-axis shows how many data points fall within that range. In this histogram, the bars indicate the count of values within each specified range.

The histogram reveals that the data is centered around a value of 12, with values spanning roughly from 8 to 16. The shape of the histogram is approximately bell-shaped, suggesting that the data may follow a normal distribution.
