## Meet the penguins

The `penguins` data contains size measurements for 
penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, 
Antarctica.

The three species of penguins have quite distinct 
distributions of physical dimensions (@fig-penguins).

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```
